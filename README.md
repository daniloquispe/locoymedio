# Loco y medio

This is a [WordPress](https://wordpress.org) theme I made for [my personal blog (with the same name
xD)](https://locoymedio.xyz) while I started learning how to make WordPress themes.

## A little history

Across my personal blog's life, I had test and use various WordPress themes with despaired results. I tested with
various themes, and all of these were (and are) good themes and work fine, I have no complains about any of these
themes; but there was something that themes hadn't. While I started learning WordPress development, I started testing
new ideas, and began creating a Fictive (a theme I saw enough original and simple) child theme, customizing some
templates here and there. But soon, that's not enough. So, why don't I create my own custom theme?

And so, this theme was born. Mainly inspired by above-mentioned [Fictive](https://wordpress.com/theme/fictive) theme and
taking some ideas from [Sorbet](https://wordpress.com/theme/sorbet) and other themes, I'm currently developing this
theme in my free time. I don't have much free time, but at least it already took its first (and hardest) step: To show
itself as a (limited) working theme in a real-world blog!

## Features

This theme, although it's not finished yet, has all basic options for a personal blog:

* Compatible with WordPress 4.x y 5.x
* Inspiration for design and layout from Fictive and Sorbet themes (inactive themes nowadays)
* Made with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/) for responsive layout
* 2 menu zones (main and social icons)
* Post types and featured image
* Editable hero image (the big full-width image in home page)
* Visible tag and category descriptions on website
* Blogroll page template

Theme is made with HTML5, CSS3, [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), [Animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate) and,
in first versions, [Bootstrap 3.3.7](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/) for mobile layout support. For my bad luck, a
few days after my first theme's release,
[Bootstrap 4.0 beta](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) was released, so I started 
migration from Bootstrap 3.

## Future plans

As I said, this theme is far from finished. Yes, I use it in my blog and works well, but there are still lacking 
features, and I hopefully could solve while I have time:

* Some CSS styles are non-editable via WordPress theme customization page
* Main menu isn't fully responsive yet
* Theme isn't (fully) translatable yet

My medium-term goal is to release an 1.0 version and make it available for anyone (not just me) ðŸ˜€

But before that moment comes, any comment or suggestion, idea or (constructive) critic will be welcomed ðŸ˜‰
